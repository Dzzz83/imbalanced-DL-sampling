# Experiment Log: MoE Gate Routing — Imbalanced-DL-Sampling

## ⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS TO AI MODELS — DO NOT MODIFY THIS SECTION

This file is the permanent research memory for this project.
Follow these rules exactly.

### Purpose
1. Track every experiment attempted (successful or failed)
2. Prevent re-suggesting approaches that already failed
3. Provide evidence-based context for proposing new experiments

### Rules for AI Models Reading This File
- **NEVER suggest** any approach listed in the FAILED APPROACHES table
- **Check the IDEAS NOT YET TRIED table** before proposing anything — it may already be planned
- When analyzing results, reference experiment numbers (e.g., "as seen in Exp #N")
- Base new hypotheses on the evidence in this log, not generic knowledge
- If tables or entries contain [FILL IN] placeholders, treat that data as unknown — do not invent values

### Rules for Logging New Experiments (After Each Training Run)
When a new experiment completes, append a new entry to EXPERIMENT HISTORY
using the exact format below. Place newest entries at the BOTTOM of that
section. Then update the FAILED APPROACHES or IDEAS tables if applicable.

**Required entry format:**

### Experiment N: [Short Descriptive Name]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Hypothesis:** [One sentence: what you believed would happen]
**Changes:** [Bullet list: exactly what differed from prior run]
**Results:**
- Overall Acc: XX.X%
- Head: XX.X% | Middle: XX.X% | Tail: XX.X%
- NLL: X.XX
- Gate routing distribution: CE XX% / LA XX% / BS XX%
**Outcome:** [✅ SUCCESS / ❌ FAILED / ⏳ INCONCLUSIVE]
**Root Cause / Why It Worked:** [1-3 sentences grounded in the data]
**Next Step:** [What this result implies should be tried next]

### Rules for Updating Tables
- **FAILED APPROACHES:** Add an entry ONLY when an experiment conclusively fails. Include the root cause so future models understand *why* it failed, not just *that* it failed.
- **IDEAS NOT YET TRIED:** When proposing a new idea, first add it here with status "Proposed". After testing, update status to "Tested — see Exp #N" and move it to the appropriate section if it failed.
- **SUCCESSFUL APPROACHES:** Add only when an experiment beats the uniform-averaging baseline.
- **BASELINE REFERENCE:** Update whenever new baseline numbers are established.

# FAILED APPROACHES — DO NOT SUGGEST

| # | Approach | Root Cause of Failure | Exp # | Date |
|---|----------|----------------------|-------|------|
| 1 | Mini-MLP with BatchNorm on Raw Logits | Non-linear architecture did not fix the uniform weight distribution. The gate still acted as a peak-detector because raw logit magnitude spikes dominate the dot product math regardless of gate depth. | 10 | 2024-05-29 |
| 2 | Probability Routing + Switch Load Balancing Loss | Switch loss successfully balanced routing weights (fixing BS starvation), but probability-space mixing caused the gate to collapse to uniform routing (~33% for all experts), failing to beat the baseline. | 11 | 2024-05-30 |

# IDEAS NOT YET TRIED

| # | Idea | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Disagreement Gating | Proposed | MED | Only train/invoke the gate when experts disagree. Removes easy samples, allowing gate to focus on hard, tail-heavy samples. |
| 2 | Logit-Space Mixing (Product of Experts) | Under consideration | HIGH | Change mixture from `sum(w_i * p_i)` to `softmax(sum(w_i * z_i_adjusted) / T)` to sharpen decision boundaries and prevent uniform collapse. Pending gradient verification. |
